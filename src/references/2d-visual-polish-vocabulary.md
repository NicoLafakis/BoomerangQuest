# Part One: Animation Principles

## Classic Animation Terms

**Squash and Stretch**
The most important principle. Objects compress on impact and elongate during fast movement. A character landing from a jump squashes down, then stretches back up. A ball bouncing flattens when it hits the ground. This single technique adds more life to animation than almost anything else.

**Anticipation**
Movement begins with a preparatory motion in the opposite direction. Before jumping up, a character crouches down. Before throwing, the arm pulls back. This telegraphs actions and makes them feel weighty.

**Follow-Through and Overlapping Action**
Different parts of a character move at different rates. When the body stops, the cape keeps moving. When the arm finishes a swing, the hand trails behind slightly. Hair, cloth, and appendages follow the main mass with delay.

**Secondary Animation / Secondary Motion**
Elements that react to primary movement but are not directly controlled. The way Ori's wisps trail behind. The flutter of a cloak. Dangling accessories that swing with momentum. These details make characters feel present in their world.

**Ease In / Ease Out (Easing)**
Nothing starts or stops instantly. Movement accelerates from rest and decelerates before stopping. The mathematical curves that control this are called easing functions: ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, cubic, quadratic, elastic, bounce.

**Smear Frames**
In traditional animation, fast movements use elongated, blurred shapes that exist for only one or two frames. The eye blends them into perceived motion. Digital games can replicate this with stretched sprites or motion trails.

**Arcs**
Natural movement follows curved paths, not straight lines. A swinging arm traces an arc. A jumping character follows a parabola. Breaking this principle makes movement feel robotic.

## Modern Game Animation Terms

**Tweening / Interpolation**
Automatically generating intermediate frames between keyframes. Linear interpolation moves at constant speed. Curved interpolation applies easing. Lerp (linear interpolation) and slerp (spherical linear interpolation) are common functions.

**Skeletal Animation / Bone Animation**
Characters are built as hierarchies of bones that can be rotated and positioned. Sprites attach to bones. This allows smooth blending between poses and procedural adjustments. Spine and DragonBones are popular tools.

**Sprite Sheet Animation**
Traditional frame-by-frame animation using a grid of pre-drawn images. Each frame is a complete drawing. Higher frame counts create smoother motion but require more art assets.

**Procedural Animation**
Movement generated by code rather than pre-authored. Physics simulations, inverse kinematics, and algorithmic motion. Allows dynamic response to game state. Ori's movement has procedural elements layered over authored animation.

**Inverse Kinematics (IK)**
Calculating joint positions to place an end point (like a hand or foot) at a specific location. Allows characters to naturally reach for objects or plant feet on uneven terrain.

**Animation State Machine**
A system that manages transitions between animation states (idle, run, jump, fall, attack). Defines which transitions are allowed, how they blend, and what triggers them.

**Animation Blending**
Smoothly transitioning between two animations rather than cutting instantly. Crossfading over several frames. Allows fluid movement between states.

**Additive Animation**
Layering animations on top of each other. A breathing animation plays constantly while other actions happen. A head-turn layer adjusts where the character looks without changing the body animation.

**Root Motion**
Movement driven by the animation itself rather than code. The character moves forward because the animation moves the root bone forward. Creates very natural-feeling locomotion.

# Part Two: Visual Effects Terminology

## Particle Systems

**Particle Emitter**
A source point that spawns particles with defined properties: initial velocity, color, size, lifetime. Particles update independently according to physics and fade rules.

**Particle Behaviors**
- **Velocity over lifetime:** Particles speed up, slow down, or change direction
- **Size over lifetime:** Particles grow, shrink, or pulse
- **Color over lifetime:** Particles shift hue, fade alpha, or cycle colors
- **Rotation over lifetime:** Particles spin at varying rates
- **Gravity/forces:** External influences that affect particle movement

**Burst vs Continuous Emission**
Burst emitters spawn many particles at once (explosions, impacts). Continuous emitters spawn particles over time (fire, smoke, trails).

**Sub-emitters**
Particles that spawn their own particles. A firework particle explodes into spark particles. Adds complexity and richness.

**Particle Pooling**
Reusing particle objects rather than creating and destroying them. Important for performance when spawning many particles.

## Screen Effects

**Bloom / Glow**
Bright areas bleed light into surrounding pixels, creating a soft halo. Makes light sources feel radiant. Ori uses this extensively on the spirit and environmental lights.

**Motion Blur**
Fast-moving objects leave trails of their previous positions. Can be per-object or full-screen. Creates sense of speed.

**Screen Shake / Camera Shake**
Rapid small movements of the camera/viewport. Communicates impact and intensity. Should have falloff (starts strong, diminishes quickly) and can be directional.

**Hit Stop / Hit Pause / Freeze Frame**
Brief pause (2-10 frames) when attacks connect. Makes impacts feel powerful. Both attacker and target freeze. Ori uses subtle hit stop on combat.

**Chromatic Aberration**
Color channels (red, green, blue) separate slightly at screen edges, mimicking lens distortion. Adds cinematic feel. Use sparingly.

**Vignette**
Darkening around screen edges, focusing attention on center. Adds atmosphere and frames the action.

**Film Grain**
Subtle noise overlay mimicking analog film. Adds texture and warmth. Usually very subtle in games.

**Letterboxing**
Black bars at top and bottom of screen during cinematic moments. Signals importance, creates widescreen feel.

**Screen Flash**
Brief full-screen color overlay. White flash on big hits. Red flash on damage. Communicates events that happen too fast to see clearly.

**Slowdown / Bullet Time / Time Dilation**
Reducing game speed temporarily. Used for dramatic moments, precision gameplay, or emphasizing impacts. Ori slows time during certain abilities.

**Speed Lines**
Radiating lines from screen center during fast movement. Manga/anime technique that communicates velocity.

## Lighting Effects

**Dynamic Lighting**
Lights that move, change intensity, flicker, or respond to game events. Torches that waver. Character abilities that emit light. Environmental lights that react to player proximity.

**Normal Mapping (for 2D)**
Using a normal map texture to calculate how light interacts with a flat sprite, creating the illusion of 3D depth. Allows 2D sprites to respond realistically to dynamic lights.

**Rim Lighting / Edge Lighting**
Light concentrated at object edges, creating a halo effect that separates subjects from backgrounds. Makes characters "pop" visually. Very prominent in Ori.

**Volumetric Lighting / God Rays / Light Shafts**
Visible beams of light passing through atmosphere. Dust motes catch the light. Rays stream through tree canopies or windows. Extremely effective for atmosphere.

**Ambient Occlusion**
Darkening in corners and crevices where light would naturally be blocked. Adds depth and grounding. Can be baked into 2D art or calculated dynamically.

**Specular Highlights**
Bright spots where light reflects directly toward the camera. Makes surfaces look shiny or wet. The gleam on Ori's eyes.

**Emissive Materials**
Surfaces that appear to emit their own light, glowing independently of scene lighting. Ori's body, spirit flames, magical elements.

**Light Cookies / Light Masks**
Patterns that shape light output, like light through leaves creating dappled shadows. Adds complexity to lighting without additional light sources.

**Global Illumination**
Light that bounces off surfaces and illuminates other surfaces indirectly. Creates natural, soft lighting. Computationally expensive, often approximated in 2D.

# Part Three: Environment and Background

## Parallax and Depth

**Parallax Scrolling**
Background layers move at different speeds based on perceived distance. Distant mountains move slowly. Nearby bushes move quickly. Creates strong depth illusion.

**Multi-Layer Parallax**
Many parallax layers (Ori uses 10+) creating complex depth. Each layer has its own scroll speed, often with subtle differences that create rich environments.

**Foreground Elements**
Layers in front of the playable space, partially obscuring the action. Grass, branches, particles that pass between camera and character. Adds depth and immersion.

**Atmospheric Perspective / Aerial Perspective**
Distant objects are less saturated, lower contrast, and shifted toward blue/gray. Mimics how atmosphere affects light over distance. Creates natural depth cues.

**Depth Layering**
Organizing visual elements by depth: far background, mid background, playable layer, near foreground, particle layer, UI layer. Clear separation aids readability.

**Z-Sorting**
Ordering objects by depth so they draw in correct front-to-back (or back-to-front) order. Critical for overlapping elements to appear correct.

## Art Style Terms

**Painterly**
Art style mimicking traditional painting: visible brushstrokes, soft edges, color mixing. Ori's backgrounds are painterly, with rich texture and organic shapes.

**Hand-Painted**
Assets created through digital painting rather than vector art or 3D rendering. Has warmth and uniqueness that purely technical art lacks.

**Organic Shapes**
Curves and irregular forms inspired by nature. Contrasts with geometric/mechanical shapes. Ori's entire aesthetic is organic.

**Hard Edge vs Soft Edge**
Sharp, defined boundaries versus gradual, blurred transitions. Mixing both creates visual interest. Characters often have harder edges than backgrounds for readability.

**Color Grading / Color Correction**
Adjusting colors across the entire image for mood. Cooler tones for sadness, warmer for joy, desaturated for danger. Ori shifts color grading dramatically between areas.

**Color Harmony**
Colors that work well together. Complementary (opposites), analogous (neighbors), triadic (evenly spaced). Ori uses careful color harmony in each environment.

**Value Structure**
The pattern of light and dark across an image. Clear value structure aids readability. Characters should contrast with their backgrounds in value.

**Silhouette Readability**
How recognizable a shape is from its outline alone. Characters and enemies should be identifiable by silhouette. Critical for gameplay clarity.

# Part Four: Camera and Framing

## Camera Behavior

**Camera Smoothing / Camera Lerp**
Camera follows target with interpolation rather than locking directly. Creates smooth, organic movement. The follow speed (lerp factor) can vary by situation.

**Look-Ahead**
Camera offsets in the direction of movement, showing more of where you're going than where you've been. Gives players time to react to upcoming obstacles.

**Camera Boundaries / Camera Constraints**
Limits on where the camera can move. Prevents showing areas outside the level. Can create "rooms" where camera locks until player exits.

**Camera Zones**
Areas that override default camera behavior. Boss arenas that lock camera in place. Cinematic moments that pan to show important elements.

**Dynamic Zoom**
Camera zoom changes based on context. Zooms out during large encounters to show threats. Zooms in during intimate moments. Adds emphasis and pacing.

**Camera Trauma / Additive Shake**
Systems that accumulate camera shake from multiple sources. Each impact adds trauma that decays over time. Prevents shake from feeling mechanical.

**Screen Edge Behavior**
What happens when the player reaches the edge of the camera view. Some games allow running off-screen briefly. Others push the camera immediately.

## Cinematic Techniques

**Establishing Shots**
Camera pulls back to show the full environment before gameplay begins. Orients players to new spaces. Ori does this beautifully when entering new areas.

**Focus Pull / Rack Focus**
Shifting what is in focus, blurring foreground or background. Directs attention. Less common in gameplay but used in cutscenes.

**Pan and Tilt**
Camera movement without changing position. Pan is horizontal rotation. Tilt is vertical. Used to reveal elements gradually.

**Dolly / Tracking**
Camera movement through space. Following characters or pushing into scenes. Creates energy and engagement.

# Part Five: Game Feel and Juice

## Input Response

**Input Buffering**
Accepting inputs slightly before they can be executed, then executing when possible. Press jump before landing, and you jump immediately on landing. Reduces perceived input lag.

**Coyote Time / Hang Time**
Brief window after leaving a platform where jump is still allowed. Accounts for human reaction time. Makes platforming feel forgiving without being easy.

**Jump Buffering**
Specific input buffering for jump commands. Press jump slightly before landing, and the jump executes on ground contact.

**Variable Jump Height**
Jump height based on how long the button is held. Tap for short hop, hold for full jump. Gives precise control over aerial movement.

**Acceleration Curves**
Characters don't reach full speed instantly. They accelerate over frames according to a curve. Creates weight and momentum.

**Air Control**
How much players can influence horizontal movement while airborne. Full air control feels floaty. Reduced air control feels committed. Ori has generous air control.

**Landing Recovery**
Brief delay or animation when landing from height. Communicates impact. Can be gameplay-relevant (can't immediately act) or purely visual.

**Turn Speed / Turn Delay**
Time to change direction. Instant turns feel responsive but weightless. Delayed turns feel heavy but grounded. Balance based on desired feel.

## Impact and Feedback

**Juice**
Industry term for effects that make actions feel satisfying. Particles, sounds, screen shake, flashes, slowdown. "Juicing" is adding these effects.

**Game Feel**
The holistic sensation of controlling a game. The sum of input response, feedback, animation, and audiovisual effects. What makes movement feel "good" or "bad."

**Impact Frames**
Brief changes during hit moments: color shift, size pulse, position offset. Makes impacts visible even at high speed.

**Knockback**
Physical displacement from being hit. Can be purely visual or gameplay-relevant. Direction, distance, and recovery time all factor into feel.

**Hitstun**
Period after being hit where the victim cannot act. Related to but distinct from hit stop. Longer hitstun means longer vulnerability.

**Recovery Frames**
Frames after an action where the character cannot perform other actions. Adds commitment to choices. Balances powerful moves.

**Feedback Loops**
Systems where player actions create clear responses that inform future actions. Hit enemy, see damage number, hear sound, see particles, understand effect, adjust aim for next hit.

# Part Six: Post-Processing and Rendering

## Shader Effects

**Shader**
A program that runs on the GPU to determine how pixels are drawn. Controls color, transparency, distortion, and special effects.

**Fragment/Pixel Shader**
Shader that operates on individual pixels. Used for color manipulation, effects, and blending.

**Vertex Shader**
Shader that operates on geometry points. Used for distortion, displacement, and transformation.

**Dissolve / Disintegration**
Objects fade out by having pixels disappear according to a pattern (usually noise-based). Common for deaths and transitions.

**Distortion / Refraction**
Bending the image behind an object, like heat shimmer or water ripple. Achieved by offsetting UV coordinates.

**Outline / Stroke**
Colored border around sprites. Can be screen-space (constant pixel width) or world-space (scales with zoom). Aids readability.

**Color Replacement / Palette Swap**
Changing specific colors in a sprite. Used for damage flashes, power-ups, or variants.

## Blending Modes

**Alpha Blending**
Standard transparency where opacity determines visibility of layers beneath.

**Additive Blending**
Colors add together. Black becomes invisible. Used for light effects, fire, magic. Makes things glow.

**Multiplicative Blending**
Colors multiply together. White becomes invisible. Used for shadows and darkening.

**Screen Blending**
Inverse of multiply. Lightens without overexposing. Good for soft glows.

## Compositing

**Render Layers**
Separating scene elements into distinct rendering passes. Allows different effects on different layers.

**Render Targets / Frame Buffers**
Textures that receive rendered output. Used for multi-pass effects where the scene is rendered, processed, then rendered again.

**Post-Processing Stack**
Series of effects applied after the scene is rendered. Bloom, color grading, vignette, etc. Order matters.

**HDR Rendering**
Rendering with color values beyond 0-1 range, then tone-mapping back. Allows more realistic light handling and better bloom.

# Part Seven: Specific Ori Techniques

## What Makes Ori Special

**Layered Particle Systems**
Ori doesn't just have particles; it has multiple overlapping particle systems creating depth. Fireflies in front, motes in mid-ground, distant sparkles in back.

**Environmental Reactivity**
The world responds to Ori's presence. Grass bends. Water ripples. Flowers sway. Light intensifies near the spirit. Creates sense of connection to the world.

**Continuous Motion**
Nothing in Ori is truly static. Backgrounds shift subtly. Plants sway. Particles always drift. Light sources pulse gently. This constant gentle motion makes the world feel alive.

**Color Storytelling**
Ori uses color to communicate safety, danger, sadness, and hope. Warm golden tones for home, cold blues for danger, vibrant greens for restoration. Players read emotion before conscious thought.

**Sound-Visual Sync**
Audio and visual effects are tightly synchronized. Ori's footsteps match animation frames. Ability sounds sync with particle bursts. This precision creates subconscious satisfaction.

**Scale and Framing**
Ori frequently contrasts the small character against vast environments. This creates awe and emphasizes the journey's scope. Camera pulls back for vistas, pushes in for intimate moments.

**Readable Chaos**
Even in busy scenes, important elements remain clear. Ori's glow distinguishes the character. Enemies have distinct silhouettes. Hazards have consistent visual language. Beauty doesn't compromise playability.

# Conclusion: Implementing Polish

When requesting or implementing these effects, consider:

**Prioritize feel over flash.** Input response and animation quality matter more than particle counts. A game that feels good to control with simple visuals beats a beautiful game that feels sluggish.

**Layer effects deliberately.** Each effect should have clear purpose. Screen shake on impact communicates force. Bloom on abilities communicates power. Random effects without meaning become noise.

**Maintain readability.** Every visual flourish that obscures gameplay is a cost. Balance atmosphere against clarity. Players must always understand what's happening.

**Consider performance.** Complex particles, multiple render passes, and shader effects have CPU/GPU costs. Profile regularly. Optimize early. Cut effects that don't justify their cost.

**Study references frame-by-frame.** Record footage of Ori, Hollow Knight, or Celeste and step through it frame by frame. See exactly how effects are timed, layered, and triggered.

The language in this document gives you vocabulary to research, request, and discuss these techniques. The implementations vary by engine, platform, and project, but the concepts transfer universally.

Polish is not one thing. It is hundreds of small things, each nearly invisible alone, that combine into the feeling that a game was made with love.
